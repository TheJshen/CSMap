### Installation Instructions

The minimum SDK version that this application is intended to run on is 17 (Android 4.2). The minimum SDK that was tested was version 19 (Android 4.4) on a Samsung Galaxy S4. Despite this, any device that is Android 4.2 or above should have no problems running the application.

The device that will be used to test the application must have GPS enabled and some form of internet connection during testing (for tracking routes, Finding current location, etc.). Furthermore, to install the program, the computer must have [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) installed. ADB is installed standard with Android SDK's platform-tools. Finally, the phone that will run the program must have debug mode activated. The method for this varies between SDK versions. The following links are methods for common SDKs fulfilling the aforementioned requirements:

- [4.2/4.3](http://www.syncios.com/blog/enable-developer-optionsusb-debugging-mode-on-devices-with-android-4-2-jelly-bean/)
- [4.4](http://androidcentral.us/2013/11/enable-developers-options-android-4-4-kitkat/)
- [5.0](http://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android-5-lollipop.htm)

After all these prerequisites are satisfied, one can simply pull the repository from GitHub, plug in the testing device via USB, and run the default configuration. After the code compiles, the program will be installed on the test device and will be running.
